# Devices API

REST API for managing devices, built with **Spring Bootâ€¯3** and **Javaâ€¯21**.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Spring Boot 3.5.5
- Java 21
- Gradle 8.14.3 (via Gradle Wrapper)
- JUnit 5 (unit + integration tests)
- JaCoCo (code coverage)
- PIT Mutation Testing (test robustness)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD with badges)

## âœ… Whatâ€™s Configured

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) runs on every push and PR:
    - Builds with Gradle 8.14.3
    - Runs unit tests and integration tests
    - Executes PIT mutation tests
    - Generates JaCoCo coverage (instruction coverage from report-level summary)
    - Creates and commits badges (coverage + mutation) to `docs/`

### Testing
- Unit tests in `src/test/java`
- Integration tests in `src/integrationTest/java`
    - Defined in `gradle/test/integration.gradle` as a separate source set
    - Task `integrationTest` runs after `test` and is part of `check`
    - Inherits dependencies from `testImplementation`

### Code Quality & Reporting
- JaCoCo:
    - Instruction coverage derived from the report-level `<counter type="INSTRUCTION">`
    - HTML: `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`
    - XML: `build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml`
- PIT:
    - Mutation score and full HTML report at `build/reports/pitest/index.html`

### Shared Dependencies
- Centralized in `gradle/dependencies.gradle` and applied from the root `build.gradle`

## ðŸš€ Commands
```bash
# Full build: clean, unit + integration tests, mutation testing, reports
./gradlew clean build

# Only unit tests
./gradlew test

# Only integration tests
./gradlew integrationTest

# JaCoCo report (HTML + XML)
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
